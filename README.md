<b>Technologies</b> I used in this project were:
Grid,
Responsive layout,
Media queries
<br>
<br>
*Challenges I faced:
<br>
While the project didn't really required for me to learn anything new that I didn't already knew - I realized that I have still few problems:
- When I write a code I tend to create new CSS lines of the code that could be reused from the other divs, in the future I will try to look first at the design and see what elements can use the same CSS code instead overwriting stuff,
- Grid, while it wasn't as bad as last few attempts I still seem to struggle as to how design the divs correctly;
